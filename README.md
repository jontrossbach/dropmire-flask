Dropmire
========

Dropmire is a flask application used by my team to track points of contact for each community
we help. The system is based around a email workflow, where messages are sent on a regular basis to verify
that a point of contact is still valid. If no answer is heard, then it is automatically escalated to the manager and/or 
a super admin to fix the situation.

This is currently still a prototype and as such might never be finished. The deployment will be done on Openshift.
